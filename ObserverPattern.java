In your Smart Home System project, the Observer Pattern can 
be effectively used to manage real-time 
updates and notifications between various smart devices 
and the system's central control unit. This pattern is 
particularly useful for scenarios where multiple components
 need to react to changes in the state of a subject, 
 such as a central controller monitoring the status of 
 different devices (e.g., lights, thermostat, security systems).

 Imagine you have a smart home system where the central
  control unit (the subject) monitors different smart 
  devices (the observers). When the state of a device 
  changes (e.g., a light is turned on or off), the central 
  control unit needs to notify all subscribed devices, allowing t
  hem to react accordingly (e.g., adjusting energy consumption or 
  updating the user interface).

How It Works:
Subject: The class representing the central control unit that maintains
 a list of observers and notifies them of state changes
  (e.g., SmartHomeController).
Observer: An interface that defines the method to 
be called when the subject's state changes (e.g., DeviceObserver).
Concrete Observer: Classes that implement the observer interface 
and define the specific actions to be taken when notified 
(e.g., Light, Thermostat, and SecuritySystem).
