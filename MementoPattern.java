In the context of your Smart Home System project, 
the Memento Pattern can be applied to store the states 
of various devices and their configurations, 
allowing users to restore these states when needed. 
This is particularly useful in scenarios where users 
may want to revert changes made to the system settings or configurations.

Use Case in Smart Home System:
Consider a situation where users can change the settings 
of their smart devices (e.g., light brightness, thermostat 
temperature, security system configurations). If a user mistakenly 
changes the settings and wants to revert to a previous configuration, 
the Memento Pattern can be employed to save and restore these 
configurations seamlessly.

Code 
public class SmartHomeSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmartDevice smartLight = new SmartDevice();
        DeviceStateManager stateManager = new DeviceStateManager();

        // Set and save the device configuration
        smartLight.setConfiguration("Brightness: 50%");
        stateManager.saveState(smartLight);

        // Change the device configuration
        smartLight.setConfiguration("Brightness: 80%");

        // Restore the saved configuration
        stateManager.restoreState(smartLight);
    }
}

The DeviceMemento class captures the state of the 
SmartDevice when requested. The SmartDevice can create 
a memento and restore its state from it.
The DeviceStateManager acts as the caretaker, managing
 the mementos and facilitating the save and restore operations.
