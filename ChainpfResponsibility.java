Chain of Responsibility Pattern can be effectively utilized 
to manage requests or commands sent to different components 
of the smart home system, such as handling alerts, managing 
device states, or addressing user complaints related to the 
system's functionalities.

Define an Alert class to encapsulate the details of an alert, 
such as its severity level.
Create an abstract Handler class that defines the method 
for processing alerts and a reference to the next handler in the chain.
Implement concrete handlers (e.g., LowBatteryHandler, 
SecurityBreachHandler, GeneralHandler) that handle specific 
types of alerts based on their severity.
Each handler can either process the alert or pass it to 
the next handler in the chain
