The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only 
one instance, and it provides a global point of access 
to that instance. This is especially useful when dealing 
with resources like database connections, where having 
multiple connections could lead to unnecessary resource usage and errors.

n the context of managing database connections, 
a singleton ensures that there is only one connection 
instance throughout the application. This prevents multiple 
connections from being created unnecessarily, conserving resources 
and ensuring thread safety in multi-threaded environments.

OOP Principles:

Encapsulation: The singleton class hides 
its instance management logic from the rest of the application.

Modularity: The singleton can be used 
across different parts of the application without 
needing to create multiple instances, ensuring efficient
 resource management.

Global Access: The singleton provides a single point
 of access to the shared resource (database connection), 
 simplifying the management of the resource.
